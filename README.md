# Make your First Android App here! :tada:

New to Android?  
New to Java?  
Don't know where to Start?  
Don't know how to Start? :confused:  

**Here is the One Stop Solution for Every Newcomer!**

## 1. Begin with learning about Android Studio 4.2! How it works and learn about the general steps. :octocat:

You can read the following book, take the following courses/videos.

### 1.1 Here is the book
* [Hands-on App Development in Android Studio 4.2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B096TL8VMP) (22 Complete Android Cases with Step-by-Step Instruction to Grow from Novice to Android Expert)

### 1.2 The Youtube Tutorials/Videos are underconstruction :free:

## 2. Download the cases here! Follow these steps (Better try it yourself first!)

Each case is organized as a seperated project in Github repo. 

### 2.1 Fork the Repository :fork_and_knife:(commonly called as Repo)
Fork the Repo by clicking on the Fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this Repo in your Github account.
Don't forget to `Star`it!

### 2.2 Clone the Repo Locally

* Go to your GitHub account and to the forked Repo, click on the `Clone or Download` button and then click the Copy to Clipboard Icon.:clipboard:
* Now open Command Line/Terminal.
* Switch to the Directory where you want to Clone this Repo.
* Run this Command

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Hello-World.git
  ```

### 2.3 Create a branch :twisted_rightwards_arrows:
Change to the Repo directory on your Computer by running
```
cd Hello-World
```
Now create a branch
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
A good way to name your branch is *<your-username>#<issue-number>*
For example:
```
git checkout -b shreya#11
```
*NOTE: The issue number for this is [#11](https://github.com/Novice-Paradigm/Hello-World/blob/master/README.md)*

### 2.4 Make necessary changes :white_check_mark:
* Go to [Contributors](https://github.com/Novice-Paradigm/Hello-World/tree/master/Contributors) directory
* Create a file:page_facing_up:.	
* Write about Yourself (in any Language)
  - Name
  - School/College you are studying at or Company you are working at
  - Your github username or link to your github profile
  - Anything else you want to write  
  *Check [Sample](https://github.com/Novice-Paradigm/Hello-World/blob/master/Contributors/Sample.md)*
* Save the File.

### 2.5 Run in your Android Studio

Enjoy :blush:
