**Here is the One Stop Solution for Every Newcomer!**

You can read the following book, take the following courses/videos.

## 2. **Three ways** to get the cases from Github!

Each case is organized as a seperated project in Github repo. 

### Option 1. Fork the Repository :fork_and_knife:(commonly called as Repo)
If you already have Githup account: Fork the Repo by clicking on the Fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this Repo in your Github account.
Don't forget to `Star`it!
